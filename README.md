## BusMall Project

This web page allows a user to track how many times they click on an image they like, which is pulled at random from an array of images. When 25 pictures are "liked," the user can click a "View Results" button, which displays how many times each picture was liked, along with how many times it was shown.

### Reflections and Comments

I enjoyed being able to apply what I have learned so far, especially loops and events. I'm excited to see where this project will go.
